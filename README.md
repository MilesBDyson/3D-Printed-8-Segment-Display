  This 8 Segment Display has 14 2x3x4 mm square LED's and a single 3mm for the Decimal Point.
  
  I did allow tolerances for fitting, however depending on your Printer you may need to adjust
  the temp accordingly if parts fit two tight print them a bit cooler. it will make a huge difference.
  
  Base can be printed out with any color you like
  Segments were printed with translucent Red with Red LED's
  
  The Display is PCB compliant if you wish to mount them on one.
  can be driven by 74HC595 shift register, one per Digit.
